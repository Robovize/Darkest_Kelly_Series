                      This is a medieval real story that never was told, in a period and a country not exposed enough. A
                      story that offers justice for all women who were hanged and burned as a witch, with a more
                      realistic
                      input about the old religion.

                      With the current after-pandemic situation we are living now, Darkest Kelly is the perfect escapism
                      for
                      the wide audience of The Witcher, with a more mature approach of fantasy/historical series such as
                      Vikings, Taboo and Outlander, but with mainly strong-female cast and a dark twist. Besides, it is
                      also
                      current in its inclusive message intrinsic in isolated and lonely characters who come together
                      towards
                      a common goal.

                  The Christ Church crypt was made into a market, meeting place for business and even a pub (as a 1633
                  letter shows: …”a tippling place for beer, wine and tobacco.”). It is also known that women were both
                  strangled and burned publicly, whereas men guilty of murder were hanged without the additional
                  torture.

                  The Brothel was in Maiden
                  Tower on Cooper Alley and was owned by
                  Dorcas Kelly and Maria Lewellyn as her
                  successor.<br>
                  It is known that Maria was arrested, endured
                  a trial and sentenced to death for procuring
                  a child aged 12 or 13, Mary Neal for the
                  use of Luttrell’s son, probably to cure him
                  as people used to believe that sex with a
                  virgin would cure venereal diseases.
                  Mary was enticed into delivering a letter to
                  Maria when she was raped. Other harlots
                  supported Maria, claiming that the little girl
                  was lying, and she was, at that tender age,
                  a harlot herself. In the meantime, both of
                  Mary’s parents were arrested for robbery
                  and imprisoned, where Anne (Mary
                  stepmother), who was heavily pregnant
                  died. What became of Mary, her father and
                  Maria after that we may never know…

                <p class="p">The Hellfire Club (or “Order
                  of the Friars of St. Francis Wycombe”), was
                  a name given to high secret society rakes
                  established in Britain and Ireland in the 18th
                  century. The clubs existed since 1719 and
                  were rumoured to be meeting places for
                  nobleman’s and people involved in politics,
                  where they could take part in immoral acts.

                <p class="p">
                  The Irish Hellfire Club is in Mount
                  Pellier Hill, Dublin: Its motto was: Do
                  what thou wilt (Fais ce que tu voudras). It is also known that they drunk “scaltheen”,
                  used to wear red uniforms, had a black cat
                  as a mascot, used to leave a chair for the
                  Devil in the garden, and their meeting place
                  was Eager Tavern near the Castle. In this
                  series, the Hellfire club stories and rumours
                  are taken to the extreme, with a masonic
                  tone, including misappropriation of money
                  and corruption, killing, sacrifice of servants
                  and prostitutes, blasphemy, occultism,
                  devil worship and dark arts.

                        As a Portuguese female writer, I found my passion at the age of 13 through
                        horror and drama films & series with social and existentialist themes.
                      </p>

                        Back in 2018, one year after being paid to write a feature script and
                        completing my master degree in Film/TV Production and Management, I
                        found myself wandering in Irish streets while pursuing more career
                        opportunities, where I immediately fell in love with the culture, the people
                        and their History. As any writer living the adventures of being in a new
                        country, something was changing inside me. I got inspired by the short
                        stories of secret societies, and women falsely accused of witchcraft and
                        murder, and consequently Darkest Kelly emerged inside me as a story that
                        was crawling inside me, yelling to be told, like a truth that must be known.
                      </p>
                      <p class="noheaderp">
                        Since then, I took up the challenge of an extensive research of Irish History,
                        mythology and occultism, and wrote 8 episodes including the TV pilot, built
                        up this pitch deck, wrote and rewrote every script according to the different
                        feedback I gathered over the year from professionals, non-professionals,
                        teachers and recent PHD graduates in Irish Medieval History.

                      I personally, identify myself with my protagonist as we both lived our lives
                      “trapped” in a small town with small-minded people; felt powerless with few or
                      non-existing opportunities to thrive; and share the same beliefs that are
                      judged, misunderstood and taboo, even nowadays. With Dorcas, I delve into
                      the darkest recesses of my imagination and unravel the same core wounds
                      as an unlovable young woman seeking her own identity in a small country that
                      also fought for its independence and national identity from its big neighbour.

                      <i>Darkest Kelly</i> will be unlike any other period Drama out there. It is original for
                      the nature of its strong female characters, double-faced villains, multi-layered
                      structure inside Dorcas’ fractured state of mind, and a mixture of genres like
                      any other period TV series are.<br>

                      The diseased period brings us to a stygian world where horror and death are
                      commonplace. Surrealism and experimental genres are found in the form of
                      dreams, hallucinations, and psychological trauma. Vibrant Celtic atmosphere.
                      Emotional themes. Rebellions. Politics. Temptation, sexual freedom and,
                      deep relationships meet in the house of sins. A balance between paranormal
                      and psyche. Those in power abuse it. Survival is tough as any woman, at any
                      time, could be accused of witchcraft and suffer a cruel death for crimes they
                      did not commit. Imprisonment, persecution, torture, sexual harassment, and
                      a very thin barrier between good and evil. Resurrection of forgotten old
                      folklore, myths and prophecies of Gods, curses, ghosts and demons that lurk
                      there, and perhaps in all of us…<br>
