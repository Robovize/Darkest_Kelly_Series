                      political and even existential themes.

                      This is a medieval real story that never was told, in a period and a country not exposed enough. A
                      story that offers justice for all women who were hanged and burned as a witch, with a more
                      realistic
                      input about the old religion.

                      With the current after-pandemic situation we are living now, Darkest Kelly is the perfect escapism
                      for
                      the wide audience of The Witcher, with a more mature approach of fantasy/historical series such as
                      Vikings, Taboo and Outlander, but with mainly strong-female cast and a dark twist. Besides, it is
                      also
                      current in its inclusive message intrinsic in isolated and lonely characters who come together
                      towards
                      a common goal.

                            Biography: <br><br>
                            Dorcas Stuart Kelly was a real Irish witch, brothel keeper and serial killer who lived in
                            Dublin and died in January 7th of 1761, partially hanged and burned at the stake for the
                            murder of the shoemaker John Dowling on St. Patricks Day. Investigators then found the
                            bodies of five men hidden in the vaults of her brothel. Rumours has it that she became
                            pregnant with the child of Sheriff Simon Luttrell, who was also a member of the Hellfire
                            Club. She demanded economical support for the child and the Sheriff not only refused but
                            also accused her of witchcraft, claiming that she killed their baby in a satanic ritual. The
                            body of the child was never found.<br><br>

                            …It is said that her ghost still haunts the city…

                            Dorcas’ Best Friend (same age as Dorcas)<br><br>
                            From Milady to Harlot…<br><br>
                            A well-behaved noble who loses everything, becomes a
                            harlot, owns a brothel and turns into a member of the
                            rebellion.<br><br>
                            Maria is born into a rich catholic family that lost their status
                            and lands. Her mother Gwineth forces her to assume another
                            identity as Kathleen and they pretend to be a noble to marry
                            well, but Maria is against it. Unlike Dorcas, Maria is full of
                            insecurities and holds different values based on the life she
                            used to have; like the importance of preserving her purity; the
                            good manners and high standards.<br>
                            However, she ends up becoming the opposite of her values
                            when she joins the rebellion group and finds her purpose
                            along with a new freedom that opens her mind and heart to
                            new passions with both women and men.<br>
                            Before, she had to feel needed and recognized but now she’s
                            humble and fights for what she believes is right.

                <p class="p">
                  During William, the Orange period in Ireland, the Catholics were persecuted, banned from their lands
                  and couldn’t vote, run schools, participate in the parliament or owning property.

                <p class="p">
                  William Conolly (1662-1729) was the Speaker of the House of Commons, lawyer and the wealthiest man in
                  Ireland, who made his fortune from following the confiscations by the crown of lands belonging to
                  Jacobite supporters. He built the first Palladian house in Ireland, the Castletown House. In 1725
                  William builds the dark lodge of the Hellfire Club, founded years later, around 1737, by Richard
                  Parsons, 1st Earl of Ross.

                  The Christ Church crypt was made into a market, meeting place for business and even a pub (as a 1633
                  letter shows: …”a tippling place for beer, wine and tobacco.”). It is also known that women were both
                  strangled and burned publicly, whereas men guilty of murder were hanged without the additional
                  torture.

                  The Brothel was in Maiden
                  Tower on Cooper Alley and was owned by
                  Dorcas Kelly and Maria Lewellyn as her
                  successor.<br>
                  It is known that Maria was arrested, endured
                  a trial and sentenced to death for procuring
                  a child aged 12 or 13, Mary Neal for the
                  use of Luttrell’s son, probably to cure him
                  as people used to believe that sex with a
                  virgin would cure venereal diseases.
                  Mary was enticed into delivering a letter to
                  Maria when she was raped. Other harlots
                  supported Maria, claiming that the little girl
                  was lying, and she was, at that tender age,
                  a harlot herself. In the meantime, both of
                  Mary’s parents were arrested for robbery
                  and imprisoned, where Anne (Mary
                  stepmother), who was heavily pregnant
                  died. What became of Mary, her father and
                  Maria after that we may never know…

                <p class="p">The Hellfire Club (or “Order
                  of the Friars of St. Francis Wycombe”), was
                  a name given to high secret society rakes
                  established in Britain and Ireland in the 18th
                  century. The clubs existed since 1719 and
                  were rumoured to be meeting places for
                  nobleman’s and people involved in politics,
                  where they could take part in immoral acts.

                  The Irish Hellfire Club is in Mount
                  Pellier Hill, Dublin: Its motto was: Do
                  what thou wilt (Fais ce que tu voudras). It is also known that they drunk “scaltheen”,
                  used to wear red uniforms, had a black cat
                  as a mascot, used to leave a chair for the
                  Devil in the garden, and their meeting place
                  was Eager Tavern near the Castle. In this
                  series, the Hellfire club stories and rumours
                  are taken to the extreme, with a masonic
                  tone, including misappropriation of money
                  and corruption, killing, sacrifice of servants
                  and prostitutes, blasphemy, occultism,
                  devil worship and dark arts.

                        murder, and consequently Darkest Kelly emerged inside me as a story that

                        up this pitch deck, wrote and rewrote every script according to the different
                        feedback I gathered over the year from professionals, non-professionals,
                        teachers and recent PHD graduates in Irish Medieval History.

                        Over the last five years, I lived in three different countries, worked on set
                        and in the office of several companies; in Development; Production, and
                        Post-production, doing video editing, pre-production work, writing script
                        reports, film reviews and managing a film festival along with industry
                        professionals such as Caroline Goodall, Craig Conway and Garen Daly and
                        worked as a production assistant and script supervisor in TV series, short
                        films and one feature in England, Spain, and Portugal.

                      I personally, identify myself with my protagonist as we both lived our lives
                      “trapped” in a small town with small-minded people; felt powerless with few or
                      non-existing opportunities to thrive; and share the same beliefs that are
                      judged, misunderstood and taboo, even nowadays. With Dorcas, I delve into
                      the darkest recesses of my imagination and unravel the same core wounds
                      as an unlovable young woman seeking her own identity in a small country that
                      also fought for its independence and national identity from its big neighbour.

                      <i>Darkest Kelly</i> will be unlike any other period Drama out there. It is original for
                      the nature of its strong female characters, double-faced villains, multi-layered
                      structure inside Dorcas’ fractured state of mind, and a mixture of genres like
                      any other period TV series are.<br>

                      The diseased period brings us to a stygian world where horror and death are
                      commonplace. Surrealism and experimental genres are found in the form of
                      dreams, hallucinations, and psychological trauma. Vibrant Celtic atmosphere.
                      Emotional themes. Rebellions. Politics. Temptation, sexual freedom and,
                      deep relationships meet in the house of sins. A balance between paranormal
                      and psyche. Those in power abuse it. Survival is tough as any woman, at any
                      time, could be accused of witchcraft and suffer a cruel death for crimes they
                      did not commit. Imprisonment, persecution, torture, sexual harassment, and
                      a very thin barrier between good and evil. Resurrection of forgotten old
                      folklore, myths and prophecies of Gods, curses, ghosts and demons that lurk
                      there, and perhaps in all of us…<br>
                      All of this with a transdimensional twist in the end.

                    <p class="noheaderp">
                      How far will a person go for their beliefs? How much will they endure to resist?
                    </p>
                    <p class="noheaderp">
                      Darkest Kelly is the story I always wanted to write. The TV show
                      that the audience currently needs, and I am the best person to do it.
